I was born in Germany in 1980, and moved to Kosovo in 1985, where I graduated from high school in 1999. After the [war in Kosovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo_War), I worked for three years as an interpreter for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo.  
In 2002, I was admitted to Yale University, and moved to the United States to start college. I received a B.A. in Environmental Studies in 2007. As part of this degree, I did fieldwork on the Galapagos Islands in the summer of 2006, and a year later completed my thesis, *Galapagos giant tortoise conservation on the island of Santa Cruz: morphological and genetic distinctiveness of a newly discovered taxon*, under the supervision of [Dr. Adalgisa Caccone](https://caccone.yale.edu/). Upon graduation, I worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Caccone until 2012. This experience resulted in a long-term involvement in population/landscape genetics projects related to a disease vector, tsetse.  
I started my Ph.D. journey in 2012, by enrolling in the Natural Resources program at Cornell University. In January 2014, I left the program at Cornell University and enrolled in the Biological Science Ph.D program at the University of Mississippi, where, under the mentorship of [Dr. Ryan Garrick](https://rcgarrick.org/), I did research on the [evolutionary history of subterranean termites in the forest ecosystems of the Appalachian Mts.](https://www.proquest.com/openview/91a7574eb4c5bc4fbdb2f49bda9e3f3e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=51922&diss=y) and received my Ph.D. in May 2020.  
For my first postdoctoral position, I moved back to Europe, and lived for a year in Sweden. I worked with Profs. [Frank Johansson](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N11-702) and [Jacob Hoglund](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=XX3226) in the Department of Ecology and Genetics at Uppsala University. There, I did research on the influence of [urban environments and landscape connectivity](https://github.com/chazhyseni/pond_conn) on aquatic invertebrate biodiversity in urban ponds, as well as (epi-)genetic variation within species.  
As of August 2021, I am an [Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE)](https://orise.orau.gov/) postdoctoral fellow at the U.S. Forest Service, where I work with [Dr. Susan Adams](https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/staff/sadams01) as part of the Aquatic Conservation and Ecology team. This work entails spatial and temporal modeling of stream temperatures aimed at disentangling effects of climate change on diversity of [crayfish communities in Mississippi streams](https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/crayfish/).
