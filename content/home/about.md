I was born in Germany in 1980, and moved to Kosovo in 1985, where I graduated from high school in 1999. After the war in Kosovo, I worked for three years as an interpreter for the United Nations Mission in Kosovo. In 2002, I was admitted to Yale University, and moved to the United States to start college. I received a B.A. in Environmental Studies in 2007. As part of this degree, I did fieldwork on the Galapagos Islands in the summer of 2006, and a year later completed my thesis, “Galapagos giant tortoise conservation on the island of Santa Cruz: morphological and genetic distinctiveness of a newly discovered taxon” under the supervision of Dr. Adalgisa Caccone. Upon graduation, I worked as a research assistant in the lab of Dr. Caccone until 2012. I started my Ph.D. journey in 2012, by enrolling in the Natural Resources program at Cornell University. About a year later, in January 2014, I left the program at Cornell University and enrolled in the Biological Science Ph.D program at the University of Mississippi, where, under the mentorship of Dr. Ryan Garrick, I received my Ph.D. in May 2020. Three months later, I started my first postdoctoral position in the Department of Ecology and Genetics at Uppsala University, under the guidance of Prof. Frank Johansson. I have been an ORISE fellow at the U.S. Forest Service in Oxford MS as of August 2021.
