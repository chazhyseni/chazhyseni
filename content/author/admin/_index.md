I am a population geneticist. My research is focused on the role spatial heterogeneity of environments plays in generating genetic variation and biodiversity. I use empirical data as well as spatial eco-evolutionary modeling. Recently, I have examined landscape connectivity among urban pond metacommunities, and the role this connectivity plays in shaping the relationship between (epi-)genetic diversity and species diversity. My current focus is on spatial and temporal modeling of stream temperatures, in order to predict responses of crayfish communities (including species endemic to Mississippi) to climate change.
