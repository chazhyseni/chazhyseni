I have been doing research in the field of Population Genetics since 2006. I am interested in the distribution of genetic variation (both neutral and adaptive) in natural environments, at different spatial and temporal scales (from Landscape Genetics to Phylogeography). To understand pattern and process, I use empirical data as well as spatial eco-evolutionary modeling. I received my Ph.D. in Biological Science from the University of Mississippi in 2020. The focal organism of my Ph.D. work was the eastern subterranean termite, *Reticulitermes flavipes*. I examined geographic and environmental influences at historical and contemporary timescales, including niche divergence of *R. flavipes* from geographically overlapping *Reticulitermes* species, and genetic divergence within the species. In addition to these historical eco-evolutionary processes, at the contemporary timescale I investigated how epigenetic mechanisms--specifically, DNA methylation--facilitate rapid responses to human-mediated disturbance of forest ecosystems. Finally, I developed a new landscape connectivity metric to help understand the impact spatial heterogeneity of environments has on biological diversity at multiple levels of organization, from alleles to communities.
