I have been doing research in the field of Population Genetics since 2006. I am interested in the distribution of genetic variation (both neutral and adaptive) in natural environments, at different spatial and temporal scales (from Landscape Genetics to Phylogeography). To understand pattern and process, I use empirical data as well as spatial eco-evolutionary modeling. I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biology at the University of Mississippi. The focal organism of my Ph.D. work is the eastern subterranean termite in the Appalachian Mountains. In addition to reconstructing the spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation, my goal is to find out how epigenetic regulation and phenotypic plasticity have contributed to the adaptive evolution of subterranean termites.
